# Phase 003 Deck Set Identity Evidence

## Result

`LaunchDeckSetAssets` now binds the enabled Classic, Radioactive, and Astral Deck Sets to three original visual system descriptors, 13 rank presentations, four suit presentations, and exactly 156 immutable base identity records. Every record uses the pinned `deck set, rank, suit` identity and slot keys from `LaunchCatalog`, and each record carries a stable asset contract ID, source and built identity, reviewed original provenance, fallback, and sorted references for frame, rank, suit, binder, and mastery presentation.

The Rojo project now contains nine bounded procedural presentation fixtures. The three frame models and three pack models use distinct palettes and materials for the launch visual systems, and three neutral fallback models remain readable without themed content. `Phase002Runtime` publishes all nine fixtures to `ReplicatedStorage.PresentationAssets`. `PresentationResolver` selects the registered themed frame for enabled card data and the matching neutral fallback for unknown or disabled data. The client records the visual system and fallback state on the preview model while preserving the existing semantic renderer layers.

## Verification

`P003-TEST-005-deckset-identity-assets` and `P003-TEST-006-deckset-fixture-project` pass with 52 records per Deck Set and three records per rank and suit slot. The full deterministic suite passes 58 tests, and the nine CI gates remain green. The current phase head artifact is `build/infinite-card-collector.rbxlx` with SHA 256 `a2bc94b102086c036623ef453fd4dff89e95b858e6b5f411163fbc9b540150a6` and SHA 512 `50e8bd636168b42bdaa806d5ef778f430d56fc5ff3b7cd7213deaea5ebdf921375c49dccc800aa36a8379a7fc5a4e1ca9c76ca9278ed2b9835c579350d57c4e2`. The asset manifest snapshot remains an entry checkpoint with no complete launch media entries, so this evidence does not claim full asset completion.

The local connected Studio edit target started and stopped Play successfully. The server `ReplicatedStorage.PresentationAssets` tree contained all nine fixtures, with no console output during the bounded run. The authorized private place remains unchanged until the complete asset bundle and dynamic renderer are ready.

## Remaining work

Reviewed source art, content hashes, reveal audio, complete binder and mastery surfaces, Edition layers, and accessibility goldens are still required by the remaining Phase 003 tasks. The resolver and fixture selection evidence is limited to the current preview path and does not claim the complete launch renderer bundle. Any change to the catalog IDs, visual system fields, or fixture identities invalidates this packet and its dependent presentation evidence.
